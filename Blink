  Blink with Potentiometer control
  Turns on an LED according to Pot Value, then off according to Pot Value, repeatedly.
  Shutsdown blinking if value is less/greater than a threshold.
  
  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO 
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino model, check
  the Technical Specs of your board  at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products
