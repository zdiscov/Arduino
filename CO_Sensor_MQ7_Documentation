MQ-7 Semiconductor Sensor for Carbon Monoxide
Profile
Sensitive material of MQ-7 gas sensor is SnO2, which
with lower conductivity in clean air. It make detection
by method of cycle high and low temperature, and
detect CO at low temperature(heated by 1.5V).The
sensor’s conductivity gets higher along with the CO
gas concentration rising. At high temperature(heated
by 5.0V),it cleans the other gases adsorbed at low
temperature. Users can convert the change of
conductivity to correspond output signal of gas
concentration through a simple circuit.
Features
It has good sensitivity to carbon monoxide in wide range, and has advantages such as long lifespan, low
cost and simple drive circuit &etc.
Main Applications
It is widely used in domestic CO gas leakage alarm, industrial CO gas alarm and portable CO gas detector.

Basic Circuit
Fig2. MQ-7 Test Circuit
Instructions: The above fig is the basic test circuit of MQ-7.The sensor requires two voltage inputs: heater
voltage (VH) and circuit voltage(VC). VH is used to supply standard working temperature to the sensor and it
can adopt DC or AC power. For this model sensor, VH should be at 1.5V±0.1V low voltage when detect CO
while should be at 5V±0.1V at non detection status(resuming period). VRL is the voltage of load
resistance RL which is in series with sensor. Vc supplies the detect voltage to load resistance RL and it
should adopts DC power.
Description of Sensor Characters
Fig4.Typical temperature/humidity characteristics
The ordinate is resistance ratio of the sensor (Rs/Rso).Rs
means resistance of sensor in 150ppm CO gas under different
tem. and humidity. Rso means resistance of the sensor in
150ppm CO gas under 20℃/55%RH.
Fig3.Typical Sensitivity Curve
The ordinate is resistance ratio of the sensor (Rs/R0
), the
abscissa is concentration of gases. Rs means resistance in
target gas with different concentration, R0 means
resistance of sensor in clean air. All tests are finished
under standard test conditions.

Cautions
1 .Following conditions must be prohibited
1.1 Exposed to organic silicon steam
Sensing material will lose sensitivity and never recover if the sensor absorbs organic silicon steam.
Sensors must avoid exposing to silicon bond, fixature, silicon latex, putty or plastic contain silicon
environment.
1.2 High Corrosive gas
If the sensors are exposed to high concentration corrosive gas (such as H2
S, SOX
, Cl2, HCl etc.), it will
not only result in corrosion of sensors structure, also it cause sincere sensitivity attenuation.
1.3 Alkali, Alkali metals salt, halogen pollution
The sensors performance will be changed badly if sensors be sprayed polluted by alkali metals salt

Test is finished in standard test conditions, the abscissa is observing time and the ordinate is VRL.
Fig6.Responce and Resume
Fig5 shows the changing of VRL in the process of putting
the sensor into target gas and removing it out.

The resistance load RL

standard test conditions.

especially brine, or be exposed to halogen such as fluorine.
1.4 Touch water
 Sensitivity of the sensors will be reduced when spattered or dipped in water.
1.5 Freezing
 Do avoid icing on sensor’s surface, otherwise sensing material will be broken and lost sensitivity.
1.6 Applied higher voltage
Applied voltage on sensor should not be higher than stipulated value, even if the sensor is not
physically damaged or broken, it causes down-line or heater damaged, and bring on sensors’
sensitivity characteristic changed badly.
1.7 Voltage on wrong pins
For 6 pins sensor, Pin 2&5 is heating electrodes, Pin (1,3)/(4,6) are testing
electrodes (Pin 1 connects with Pin 3, while Pin 4 connects with Pin 6).If
apply voltage on Pin 1&3 or 4&6, it will make lead broken; and no signal
putout if apply on pins 2&4.

2 .Following conditions must be avoided
2.1 Water Condensation
Indoor conditions, slight water condensation will influence sensors’ performance lightly. However, if
water condensation on sensors surface and keep a certain period, sensors’ sensitive will be decreased.
2.2 Used in high gas concentration
No matter the sensor is electrified or not, if it is placed in high gas concentration for long time, sensors
characteristic will be affected. If lighter gas sprays the sensor, it will cause extremely damage.
2.3 Long time storage
The sensors resistance will drift reversibly if it’s stored for long time without electrify, this drift is
related with storage conditions. Sensors should be stored in airproof bag without volatile silicon
compound. For the sensors with long time storage but no electrify, they need long galvanical aging
time for stability before using. The suggested aging time as follow:
Stable2.
Storage Time Suggested aging time
Less than one month No less than 48 hours
1 ~ 6 months No less than 72 hours
More than six months No less than 168 hours
2.4 Long time exposed to adverse environment
No matter the sensors electrified or not, if exposed to adverse environment for long time, such as high
humidity, high temperature, or high pollution etc., it will influence the sensors’ performance badly.
2.5 Vibration
Continual vibration will result in sensors down-lead response then break. In transportation or
assembling line, pneumatic screwdriver/ultrasonic welding machine can lead this vibration.
2.6 Concussion
If sensors meet strong concussion, it may lead its lead wire disconnected.
2.7 Usage Conditions
2.7.1For sensor, handmade welding is optimal way. The welding conditions as follow:
 Soldering flux: Rosin soldering flux contains least chlorine

 homothermal soldering iron
 Temperature： 250℃
 Time：less than 3 seconds
2.7.1If users choose wave-soldering, the following conditions should be obey:
 Soldering flux: Rosin soldering flux contains least chlorine
 Speed: 1-2 Meter/ Minute
 Warm-up temperature：100±20℃
 Welding temperature：250±10℃
 One time pass wave crest welding machine
If disobey the above using terms, sensors sensitivity will reduce.
